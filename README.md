#apex-frontend-boost Theme Boilerplate

This is an APEX 5.0.3 application that is forked from APEX Theme Boilerplate ( http://vmorneau.me/apex-theme-boilerplate/ ) and updated for apex-frontend-boost ( https://github.com/OraOpenSource/apex-frontend-boost )

The application export is included in this repo.

###What is this Boilerplate thing?
It's an empty APEX 5 application with basic stuff that any APEX theme needs. No pages or anything, just a few shared components templates and settings turned on.

This application is same as APEX Theme Boilerplate. However, apex-frontend-boost Theme Boilerplate has some additional changes done to the template. That is it includes DEV_ONLY Build Option and Application Process OOS APEX Front-End Boost Config to support referencing images via the standard APP_IMAGES substitution string ( https://github.com/OraOpenSource/apex-frontend-boost/blob/master/docs/apex-setup.md )

###Do I need this?
You probably don't. Building a theme from the ground up is not something you do everyday. I personally find this useful. Might as well share it, right? Please refer to Vincent Morneau blog http://vmorneau.me/apex-theme-boilerplate/

###Automatic Install
- Import the APEX application ```f14966.sql``` in your workspace.
