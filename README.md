#APEX Theme Boilerplate

For more info: http://vmorneau.me/apex-theme-boilerplate/

The application export is included in this repo.

###What is this Boilerplate thing?
It's an empty APEX 5 application with basic stuff that any APEX theme needs. No pages or anything, just a few shared components templates and settings turned on. 

###Do I need this?
You probably don't. Building a theme from the ground up is not something you do everyday. I personally find this useful. Might as well share it, right?

###Automatic Install
- Import the APEX application ```f14966.sql``` in your workspace.
